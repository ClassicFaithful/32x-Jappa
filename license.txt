EM32D IS DISTRIBUTING WITH THESE GUIDELINES BELOW:

Requirements:

1: Give clear credit.

2: Link back to the PMC listing (https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/em32d/).

3: Ask on our discord above if you have a decent sized fanbase.

4: Be honest about what you are using.

5: If you are only using a few textures, such as wool, logs, UI, etc, make sure to list the textures that we made.

6: No monetization, including link shorteners.

Things that are fine as long as the guidelines above are being followed:

1: Using them as placeholders.

2: Using as many textures as you've made yourself.

3: Use as base for mod, add on, or adventure map textures.

4: Content creators can distribute a modified copy.

5: Map makers can provide modified copies to go along with it.

6: Content creator edits made by fans are fine.

Finally:

1: If you are making an add on or mod support, we can make it official, just ask in our discord.

2: You can use any of Vattic’s textures as long as his guidelines are being followed: https://web.archive.org/web/20150607220656/http://www.minecraftforum.net:80/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1223254-faithful-32x32-pack-update-red-cat-clay-1-8, under usage guidelines

3: If we decide we don't want you using any textures from the pack then that is final. This will only be the case in unusual circumstances.

4: These guidelines can be changed at any time.
